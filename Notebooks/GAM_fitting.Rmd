I'm using this notebook to examine GAM model outputs and compare GAMs. I'm actually running/fitting the gams in Fit_GAMS_fun.R

```{r setup, eval = FALSE}
# switching eval to false up here so it doesn't run every time I try to check something quickly. Change if knitting.

### Fit individual full GAM for all species
Note: these were fit with pre-2000 fall data, but 2011 excluded. 

Re ran a few times, dropped season, then did with s(lat, lon) instead of te(lat, lon). On 9/14 I switched around the file structure so I have a folder for each model instead of separate PA/biomass folders.

### Compare GAM vs random walk for biomass model

I'm going to divide into testing and training data. KK did approximately 80/20 with most recent data as training set. It looks from KK code that she's using one dataset for both PA and biomass, so giving the biomass GAM all the zeroes. does bring the dev expl down. with haddock, was 38%, now 23. Decided after call on 7/22 that it really should be presence-only data for the biomass model, that's the point of separating PA vs. biomass. 

Still figuring out how to deal with zero biomass in the test set, however. 

I'm also dropping salinity here. Doesn't seem to be contributing enough for enough species, and since it's a climatology through 2012 I lose a lot of data, plus my whole testing set. 
```{r rwf_test}
library (forecast)

quantile (mfri_pred$year, 0.8) # 2013 os 75%, 2014 is 80%. If IU include 2013 in training, it's 77%, if I don't, it's 73.6%. Other papers used 80/20, so will include

spp_totals <- mfri_abun %>%

  filter (count > 50) %>% # need to have enough observations for the model
  filter (!species %in% c(72, 97, 89, 35, 92, 10, 49)) # just manually removing the ones that give errors. e.g. 72 only has spring post 2013 so model gets mad. 

#calculate_MASE_fun <- function (spp) {

## build dataframe, do for loop instead of function
MASE_all_spp <- data.frame()

for (spp in spp_totals$species) {
  

# link species code to scientific name in PA dataset

# signal where we are in the process
print(paste(sci_name, Sys.time()))

#Presence/absence data for species
PA_spp <- mfri_pa %>%
  # https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html need to use all_of for externally named variable

colnames (PA_spp)[2] <- "Presence"

# biomass data--need presence-only training set and presence/absence testing set

  filter (species == spp)

full_data_spp <- PA_spp %>%
  left_join (LB_spp, by = "sample_id") %>% # add abundance data
  replace_na (list(n_tot = 0, kg_tot = 0, n_log = 0, kg_log = 0)) %>% # replace all NAs (absences) with zero. what about biomass of 1? none have
  right_join (mfri_pred, by = "sample_id") # add predictor variables and cut out faulty autumn samples. should have 27524 
  
# divide into testing and training
train_spp <-  full_data_spp %>% 
    filter (year <= 2013)

# presence-only data for training
train_spp_B <- train_spp %>%

## Random walk forecast

Naive_forecast_lambda <-rwf(train_spp$kg_tot, drift=T, h= nrow (test_spp), lambda = -0.5, biasadj=T) 
# with drift = F, this is just the last value observed, repeated h times. with drift = T, random walk based on the last value, but seems totally dependent on the last value. 

# try with and without biasadj = T
Naive_forecast <- rwf (train_spp$kg_tot, drift = T, h = nrow (test_spp), lambda = NULL, biasadj = F) 

# don't see any difference with biasadj = T, with either log or total biomass. when I have both biasadj and lambda = -0.5, it does make a difference. much larger drift with biasadj = T

## Naive GAM (no environmental variables)
gam_LB_naive <- gam (kg_log ~ te(lon, lat) + year + season + s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "gaussian", 
                 data = train_spp_B)

gam_PA_naive <- gam (Presence ~ te(lon, lat) + year + season + s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "binomial", 
                 data = train_spp)

gampred_LB_naive <- predict.gam (gam_LB_naive, test_spp, type = "response")
gampred_PA_naive <- predict.gam (gam_PA_naive, test_spp, type = "response")

Eresid_naive <- mean (exp (residuals.gam (gam_LB_naive)))

ThermPred_spp_naive <- gampred_PA_naive * (exp (gampred_LB_naive)) * Eresid_naive

## Full GAM 

gam_LB <- gam (kg_log ~ te(lon, lat) + year + season + s(surface_temp) + s(bottom_temp) + s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "gaussian", 
                 data = train_spp_B)

gam_PA <- gam (Presence ~ te(lon, lat) + year + season + s(surface_temp) + s(bottom_temp) + s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "binomial", 
                 data = train_spp)

gampred_LB <- predict.gam (gam_LB, test_spp, type = "response")
gampred_PA <- predict.gam (gam_PA, test_spp, type = "response")

# KK took inverse log of LB residuals, and then one mean value for each species
Eresid <- mean (exp (residuals.gam (gam_LB)))

# ThermPred is PA prediction * log (LB prediction) * log (LB residual). MAE is absolute value of thermPred - observed biomass.
ThermPred_spp <- gampred_PA * (exp (gampred_LB)) * Eresid


## Calculate MAE
MAE_gam <- abs(ThermPred_spp - test_spp$kg_tot) 

MAE_gam_naive <- abs (ThermPred_spp_naive - test_spp$kg_tot)

MAE_rwf <- abs (Naive_forecast$mean - test_spp$kg_tot)

MAE_rwf_lambda <- abs (Naive_forecast_lambda$mean^-0.5 - test_spp$kg_tot) # should it be transformed? abs (Naive_forecast_lambda$mean^-0.5 - test_spp$kg_tot)

## Build df

MASE_spp <- data.frame (
  Species = sci_name, 
  RWF = mean (MAE_gam, na.rm = TRUE) / mean (MAE_rwf, na.rm = TRUE), # why mean instead of median? 
  RWF_lambda = mean (MAE_gam, na.rm = TRUE) / mean (MAE_rwf_lambda, na.rm = TRUE),
  Naive_GAM = mean (MAE_gam, na.rm = TRUE) / mean (MAE_gam_naive, na.rm = TRUE)
)
 

MASE_all_spp <- rbind (MASE_all_spp, MASE_spp)

}

# calculate_MASE_fun(2)

```
With bias = T and lambda = -0.5, GAM is way better for all species. mean is 0.01, median is 1.12e05, max is 0.15 (silver smelt)
Without biasadj = T, 7 are > 1.mean is 0.68, median 0.72, max 3.17. Per email from Charles Perretti on 7/22/2020, he suggested using neither lambda nor biasadj. 

"That sounds like an interesting project. It's been a while but if I remember correctly we used the random walk model as a sort of null model to compare against the GAM. I don't remember using the Box-Cox transformation, but it's basically just a way to make the data look closer to a normal distribution. In general I would vote against using it because the choice of the lambda parameter is somewhat arbitrary, and it's just a bit more difficult to explain. If you did use it though you would want to use the bias-correction to return unbiased estimates of the mean prediction. So basically I would turn it off by setting lambda = NULL, and biasadj = FALSE. But if you do use it I would set biasadj = TRUE."

For MASE table, full gam outperforms naive gam for all species for which the model worked (65) except mackerel. Did way better than rwf with lambda and biasadj. But for regular rwf, did worse in the majority of cases. Some are kind of crazy--Eutrigla_gurnardus (99) ratio is in the hundred millions, PAndalus is infinite, L. reticulatus is 6500. 

S. acanthius (dogfish) has only 251 presences in training set. It's caught most years, but looks like in the single digits of sets. 

E. gurnardus has 1386 presences. 891 in training set. It's something about very small and very large numbers. The normal rwf predictions are all very tiny numbers, median e=16. Whereas the gams are predicting some quite large numbers, log biomass up around 28. Last value of biomass training is 1.48, but last value of whole training set is 0. 
Lumpfish had good scores for everything. It has 9325 presences, 7534 in training set. 


Is the performance of rwf vs. gam dependent on having presence or absence as the last value in the training set? also seeing very few non-NA values for rwf-Lambda. only 90 /6300 for monkfish for example. 

Scomber scombrus atl mackerel, env gam performed worse than naive gam. Only 350 presences, and 211 in test set. 


Setting test set kg_log to 0 vs. -18 or something like that doesn't make a difference, because the test set kg_log actual values don't come into play for error measurement. using just kg_tot and exp(prediction). 


### DISMO model evaluations
Morely et al takes preds1 (fitted.values/gampred for PA). makes vector of presences and absences. evaluate acts on a column of predicted values at observed presences and ovserved absences

for kappa and TSS, for the full model he doesn't use a threshold. modeldiag$tssmax is max tss for full model. tssmax.tt is max from test. tss is with e.ind, prevalence threshold from full model. tss.tt is with e.ind.tt, which is the minimum difference between test evaluation and training prevalence threshold. 

takes the threshold from training data that best matches testing data--minimum absolute difference between model diag.thres.tr [prevalence] and e.tt@t
```{r dismo_PA}


library(dismo)
p <- as.vector(gampred_PA[which (test_spp$Presence == 1)])
a <- as.vector(gampred_PA[which (test_spp$Presence == 0)])

e <- evaluate (p, a)
plot (e, "ROC") # want closer to 1
e@auc

threshold(e, stat = "kappa") # 0.89
prev_th <- threshold (e, stat = "prevalence")
e.ind <- which (e@t == prev_th)

conf <- as.data.frame (e@confusion) # 4 columns, tp, fp, fn, tn

sens <- with (conf, tp/(tp + fn))

tss_max <- max (with (conf, (tp/(tp + fn) + (tn)/(tn+fp) - 1)))
tss_th <- with (conf[e.ind,], (tp/(tp + fn) + (tn)/(tn+fp) - 1))

kap_max <- max (e@kappa)
kap_th <- e@kappa[e.ind]

# find min th from training data

# fitted values from training data
p.train <- gam_PA$fitted.values[which(train_spp$Presence == 1)]
a.train <- gam_PA$fitted.values[which(train_spp$Presence == 0)]

e.train <- evaluate(p.train, a.train)

prev.th.train <- threshold (e.train, stat = "prevalence")

diff <- abs (e@t - prev.th.train)
e.ind.train <- which (diff == min(diff))


kap_tr <- e@kappa[e.ind.train]
tss_tr <- with (conf[e.ind.train,], (tp/(tp + fn) + (tn)/(tn+fp) - 1))
```

for biomass, he looked at dev explained but also predicted vs observed biomass when present==correlation cor^2
```{r morely_Biomass_Cor}

cor_B <- cor (gampred_LB[which (test_spp$Presence ==1 & !is.na(gampred_LB))], test_spp$kg_log[which (test_spp$Presence == 1 & !is.na(gampred_LB))])^2

```

Kristin also did the diebold mariano test in forecast library. E1 is naive gam thermpred minus maive gam observed biomass. E2 is gampreds full thermpred minus biomass. 
```{r dm_test}

# doesn't accept nas. also looks like shouldn't be absolute

E1 <- ThermPred_spp_naive - test_spp$kg_tot
E2 <- ThermPred_spp - test_spp$kg_tot

E1_cc <- E1 [ which (!is.na(E1) & !is.na(E2))]
E2_cc <- E2 [ which (!is.na(E1) & !is.na(E2))]

dm_gam <- dm.test (E1_cc, E2_cc, h = 1, power = 1, alternative = "greater")
dm_gam

```

### interpret results from gam diagnostics 7/25
this is SLL I think? Not 100% sure what model this refers to. 
```{r gam_diag}

gam_diag <- read_csv ("../Models/GAM_diagnostics_all_spp.csv")

suitable_spp <- gam_diag %>%
  filter (MASE_GAM < 1 & DM_GAM_p < 0.05)

```
28 species, doesn't include cod?? really very few species outperform random walk. 

# tensor simple model after call with pat
s(latlon) but tensor instead. drop season, salinity, year
```{r compare_SLL_tensor}

sll_25_stats <- read_csv ("../Models/Major_spp_summary_table_slatlon.csv")

           max_dev = max (dev_exp),
           sd_dev = sd (dev_exp))

summary (sll_25_stats)

I don't think this is quite right because I took out year for tensor. but mean AID is 14698 for tensor; 14479 for smooth. 33805 smooth lb, 34017 for tensor lb. 

comparing just l/l, depth, sst, bt: tensor is better for PA AIC by ~30, slightly better for PA dev and slightly worse for LB dev but not huge. SLL is better for LB AIC by ~50.

# More habitat variables 
### Incorporate Bormicon and temp max, min, stdev, no lat/lon

Some of these are correlated, so I'm going to run the full model and also record the single dex expl and difference in dropping each variable, maybe can take a mean or something. just doing for PA

AIC is drop minus full. So a positive value means dropping > full, so that's worse.

Salinity might be better than I had thought. seems to outperform surface temperature (mean 4.1 vs 3.9 for PA, 1.7 vs 1.65 for LB).

not really comparable though because SST variables from GLORYS are only 1993-2018.

```
Candidates: borm_14 all temp. and then tensor simple vs sll drop year?
tensor simple: AIC: PA mean 7748.167, med 7167.592	. sll drop: 7777.391, 7230.591. so tensor better for PA, but worse for LB. 
dev exp, tensor simple is basically the same for PA, slightly better. slightly worse for LB.

Okay WHY are things different between GAM diagnostics tables and GAM performance (updated) tables. Found one issue where the n_presences are not accurate with GAM_performance tables because i was left_joining instead of right_joining. but why are the MASE results so different.
```{r td_table_mase_check}
td_old_table <- read_csv ("../Models/Temp_Depth_GAM_diagnostics.csv")
td_new_table <- read_csv ("../Models/GAM_performance_Depth_Temp.csv")

which (!td_old_table$species %in% td_new_table$species) # same spp at least

mase_comp <- td_old_table %>%
  dplyr::select (species, MASE_GAM) %>%
  left_join (td_new_table, by = "species") %>%
  dplyr::select (species, MASE_GAM.x, MASE_GAM.y)


```
original gam diagnostics for dev expl and AIC were just on trainig models, so that makes sense. but no idea why MASE would be so different, that's just with training/testing data! okay it was literally a typo. forumla instead of formula, so naive LB model didn't actually update, tipped the balance in favor of naive model.

### Seeing really weird behavior in prediction rasters, may be a result of tensor spline?

Try cod model with just lat. I think this was an issue with my hammerhead models

  sci_name <- "Gadus_morhua"
  spp <- 1
  
  #grab presence/absence data for that species and attach to predictor data
  spp_PA <- mfri_pa %>%
    dplyr::select (sample_id, all_of(sci_name)) %>%
    left_join (mfri_pred, by = "sample_id")
  
  # don't know how to do this elegantly within a pipe, but change colname to presence
  colnames(spp_PA)[2] <- "Presence"
  
  
  # non-zero biomass data; this will have variable size. 
  spp_B <- mfri_abun %>%
    filter (species == spp) %>%
    left_join (mfri_pred, by = "sample_id")
  
  # define gamma
  gamma_PA <- log (nrow (spp_PA)) / 2
  gamma_B <- log (nrow (spp_B)) / 2

  
set.seed(10)

 gam_PA <- gam (Presence ~ s(lat) + year + s(surface_temp) + s(bottom_temp) +s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "binomial", 
                 data = spp_PA,
                gamma = gamma_PA)
  
  gam_LB <- gam (kg_log ~ s(lat) + year + s(surface_temp) + s(bottom_temp) +s(tow_depth_begin),
                 family = "gaussian",

seems like don't lose a lot of dev expl for PA (67 instead of 69ish), but yes for biomass (only 14% instead of 20ish). 

Run this through build prediction rasters and still have really weird behavior, really high values at higher latitudes:

s(lat,lon) seems like a good choice. Doesn't appear to be making any weird distortions, in fact looks similar to depth map. 

Going to move forward with s(lat, lon) and gamma. Redoing model fitting and predicitons starting 8/10.

showing a slight negative rltp with sst. might be that catch has been going down although temperatures have been going up so model is confused?
