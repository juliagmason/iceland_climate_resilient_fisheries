# 115 is not in the prediction data at all. going to join with 113--eastern extension. 112 is not well represented in the data (only 41 points for data with sst min/max). Going to join with 111 as a northern extension. 110 also not well represented (only 36 points), but not super clear how to handle it--represents Greenland shelf. I think makes more sense to join with 111 and 112 than with 109 for a larger prediction, but the portion of 110 that's within the EEZ is much more similar to 109. Will convert to 109 for now.
